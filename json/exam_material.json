So, data\ncommunication is simply the exchange of data between two or many users through the transmission media\nlike twisted pair cable, coaxial cable, optical fibers, radio wave, satellite microwave, etc. The user or device\nthat sends the data is the source and the user that receives the data is a receiver. For data interchange to take\nplace, the communicating devices must be a part of a system comprising of a combination of hardware and\nsoftware. Its efficiency depends on four fundamental characteristics.\nCHARACTERISTICS:\n● Delivery: Data must be delivered to the correct destination and must be received by the intended\nreceiver only.\n● Accuracy: Data delivered must be accurate. Any alteration to the data during transmission\nrenders it useless.\n● Timeliness: Data must be delivered within the ideal time else it is useless. In case of audio and\nvideo, the data must be delivered as they are produced, in the same ordered they are produced\nwithout significant delay. This kind of delivery is called real-time transmission.\n● Jitter: It is the variation in the arrival time of audio or video packets or unevenly delay in the\ndelivery of the audio or video packets.\nDATA REPRESENTATION:\nInformation is represented in various forms such as text, numbers, images, audio and video.\n● Text: In data communication, it is represented as a bit pattern, a sequence of bits (0s and 1s).\nDifferent sets of bit patterns, called code, have been designed to represent text and symbols and\nthe process of representing them is called coding. Characters can be represented in Unicode by\nusing the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).\n● Numbers: They are also represented by bit patterns. To simplify mathematical operations the\nnumber is directly converted to a binary number.\n● Images: They are also represented by bit patterns. In its simplest form, an image is composed of a\nmatrix of pixels, where each pixel is a small dot. Resolution determines the size of the pixel.\n● Audio: It refers to the recording or broadcasting of sound or music. Audio is by nature different\nfrom text, numbers, images. It is not discrete, but continuous.\n● Video: It refers to the recording or broadcasting of a picture or a movie. It can either be produced\nas a continuous entity, or can be a combination of images, each a discrete entity, arranged to\nconvey the idea of motion.\nHere are some data communication terminologies listed below:\n1. Data Channel : Channel simply means a path to carry or flow. Data channel means the flow of data or to\ncarry the data from one device to another. In other words, we can say the data channel is a computer path or\nmedium used to transfer the data from sender to receiver.\nThere are some data channel protocols:\n● SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) – Flow and Congestion Control\n● DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) – Provides Security\n● UDP (User Datagram Protocol) / IP (Internet Protocol) – Connectionless communication\nprotocol, NAT (Network address translational) traversal\n2. Baud : It’s actually a common measurement unit of data transfer. Baud rate measures the rate at which\nthe data is transferred from the sender to the receiver in the data channel. It can be expressed in terms of bps\n(bits per second). It simply determines the speed of data transfer.\n3. Bits Per Second (bps) : Its symbol is “bit/s”. It can be present in two forms i.e. bps (bits per second) and\nBps (Bytes per second). It’s also a measurement unit of speed at which the data is transferred. Some other\nforms are also present as shown in the table below:"

Bandwidth : It’s the range of frequencies over which a communication system works. It generally\nmeasures the amount of data that can be transferred in a given amount of time over a data channel. It’s the\ndifference between the highest and the lowest frequencies of a data channel. The measurement unit of\nfrequency is cycles per second i.e. hertz.\nS.No Bandwidth in\n. Type of the Signal Range of Frequency in Hertz Hertz\n1 Voice signal 300-3400 3, 100\n2 TV signal 0-5 MHz 5 MHz\n3 Digital Data 300-3400 3, 100\n4 Music Signal 20-15000 14, 980\n5. DTR (Data Transfer Rates) : It determines the rate of speed at which the data is transferred from one point\nto another. Its measurement unit is bits per second (bps), Bytes per second (Bps), or baud. In computer, data\ntransfer is mainly measured in Bytes per second. Data transfer between devices such as Hard disk and\nCD-ROM is usually measured in milliseconds.\nData Flow\nCommunication between two devices can be classified as:\n▪ Simplex\n▪ Half-duplex\n▪ Full-duplex\n▪ In the simplex mode, unidirectional communication occurs, ie, only in one direction. Out of the two\ndevices, only one can transmit at a time and the other receives only. For example, a keyboard can\nonly be used to enter the input while a monitor can only receive the output."

            "text": "▪ In Half Duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive, but not at the same time. When a\ndevice is sending while the other can only receive and vice versa. This mode is used in cases where\nthere is no need for data transfer in both directions at the same time. The entire channel capacity can\nbe used only for one direction at a time.\n▪ In Full-Duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive at the same time. The full-duplex mode\nis used when communication in both directions is required all the time. The capacity of the channel\nmust be divided between the two directions.\nCriteria of the Network\nA certain number of criteria should be met by the network. The most important criteria are:\n▪ Performance\nThe performance of a network depends on several factors like the number of users, transmission medium\ntypes, hardware capabilities, and the efficiency of the software. Performance can be measured in several\nways, including transit time and response time. The amount of time required for a message to travel from the\ndevice to another device is called transit time while response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and\na response.\n▪ Reliability\nThe frequency of the failure, the recovery time of a network after a failure, and the network’s robustness in a\ncatastrophe are used to measure the network reliability.\n▪ Security\nThe security of the information is the top priority because as the data travel from one device to another\ndevice, it can be altered with or stolen. So we protect the data from unauthorized access and viruses."

For\nexample, your monitor, mouse, and keyboard all must connect to the computer before they work. Different\nforms of the word connect. Examples of computer connections. Connections on the back of the computer.\nTypes of Connections\nThere are two possible types of connections:\n▪ Point to Point\n▪ Multipoint\nPoint to Point\nIn this connection, a dedicated link is provided between two devices. The full capacity of the link is held in\nreserve for transmission between those two devices. In this type of connection, mostly we use an actual\nlength of wire or cable to connect the two devices, and also we have many other options like microwave or\nsatellite links.\nMultipoint\nIn this type of connection, more than two specific devices share a single link. The capacity of the channel is\nshared either spatially or temporally. If many devices can use the link simultaneously, it is a spatially shared\nconnection and if users must take turns, it is called a timeshared connection.\nUses of Computer Networks\n▪ Communication Medium: Computer networks are used among different users as a communication\nmedium. For example, an email (electronic mail), video conference is generally used by the\nemployees of the company for communication purposes.\n▪ Resource Sharing: All the resources like printers, scanners, modems, programs, and data can be\nshared by all the systems in computer networks.\n▪ Server-client model: Computer networking is used as a server-client model. Here, the server is the\nmaster system that is used to store the information and is maintained by the system administrator.\nThe client is used to access the information stored in the server remotely.\n▪ E-Commerce: Computer network is also used in the field of businesses.

Message: This is most useful asset of a data communication system. The message simply refers\nto data or piece of information which is to be communicated. A message could be in any form, it\nmay be in form of a text file, an audio file, a video file, etc.\n2. Sender: To transfer message from source to destination, someone must be there who will play\nrole of a source. Sender plays part of a source in data communication system. It is simple a\ndevice that sends data message. The device could be in form of a computer, mobile, telephone,\nlaptop, video camera, or a workstation, etc.\n3. Receiver: It is destination where finally message sent by source has arrived. It is a device that\nreceives message. Same as sender, receiver can also be in form of a computer, telephone mobile,\nworkstation, etc.\n4. Transmission medium: In entire process of data communication, there must be something which\ncould act as a bridge between sender and receiver, Transmission medium plays that part. It is\nphysical path by which data or message travels from sender to receiver. Transmission medium\ncould be guided (with wires) or unguided (without wires), for example, twisted pair cable, fiber\noptic cable, radio waves, microwaves, etc."

Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.\nThe data flows in one direction, i.e.., it is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2\nconnections between each Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology. In-Ring Topology, the Token\nRing Passing protocol is used by the workstations to transmit the data.\nFigure 4: A ring topology comprises 4 stations connected with each forming a ring.\nThe most common access method of ring topology is token passing.\n● Token passing : It is network access method in which token is passed from one node ton another\nnode.\n● Token : It is a frame that circulates around network.\nThe following operations take place in ring topology are :\n1. One station is known as a monitor station which takes all the responsibility to perform the\noperations.\n2. To transmit the data, the station has to hold the token. After the transmission is done, the token is\nto be released for other stations to use.\n3. When no station is transmitting the data, then the token will circulate in the ring.\n4. There are two types of token release techniques: Early token release releases the token just after\ntransmitting the data and Delay token release releases the token after the acknowledgment is\nreceived from the receiver.\nAdvantages of this topology:\n● The data transmission is high-speed.\n● The possibility of collision is minimum in this type of topology.\n● Cheap to install and expand."

The strength of signal decreases with increasing distance\nwhich causes loss of energy in overcoming resistance of medium. This is also known as\nattenuated signal. Amplifiers are used to amplify the attenuated signal which gives the original\nsignal back and compensate for this loss.\nAttenuation is measured in decibels(dB). It measures the relative strengths of two signals or one\nsignal at two different point.\nAttenuation(dB) = 10log10(P2/P1)\nP1 is the power at sending end and P2 is the power at receiving end.\nSome where the decibel is also define in terms of voltage instead of power.In this case because power is\nproportional to the square of the voltage the formula is"

These devices act as sending\nantenna and transmission medium act as receiving antenna. Thermal noise is movement of\nelectrons in wire which creates an extra signal. Crosstalk noise is when one wire affects the other\nwire.

It does not change with time (Sometimes it is exceptionally changed in the form of small,\nrapid fluctuations that generally occur due to modulation). Suppose you want to listen to FM stereo at\nfrequency 104.8 MHz on your radio, and then once you set the frequency, the signal stays at 104.8 MHz. It\ndoes not go up to 105.1 MHz or down to 101.1 MHz. You see that your set digits on the radio's frequency\ndial stay the same at all times. The frequency of a conventional wireless signal is kept as constant to keep\nbandwidth within certain limits, and the signal can be easily located by someone who wants to retrieve the\ninformation.\nIn this conventional wireless communication model, you can face at least two problems:\n1. A signal whose frequency is constant is subject to catastrophic interference. This interference occurs\nwhen another signal is transmitted on or near the frequency of a specified signal.\n2. A constant-frequency signal can easily be intercepted. So, it is not suitable for the applications in\nwhich information must be kept confidential between the source (transmitting party) and the receiver.\nThe spread spectrum model is used to overcome with this conventional communication model. Here, the\ntransmitted signal frequency is deliberately varied over a comparatively large segment of the\nelectromagnetic radiation spectrum. This variation is done according to a specific but complicated\nmathematical function. If the receiver wants to intercept the signal, it must be tuned to frequencies that vary\nprecisely according to this function.\nReasons to use Spread Spectrum\no Spread spectrum signals are distributed over a wide range of frequencies and then collected and\nreceived back to the receiver. On the other hand, wide-band signals are noise-like and challenging to\ndetect.\no Initially, the spread spectrum was adopted in military applications because of its resistance to\njamming and difficulty intercepting.\no Now, this is also used in commercial wireless communication.\no It is most preferred because of its useful bandwidth utilization ability.\nUsage of Spread Spectrum\nThere are many reasons to use this spread spectrum technique for wireless communications. The following\nare some reasons:\no It can successfully establish a secure medium of communication.\no It can increase the resistance to natural interference, such as noise and jamming, to prevent detection.\no It can limit the power flux density (e.g., in satellite down links).\no It can enable multiple-access communications.\nTypes of Spread Spectrum\nSpread Spectrum can be categorized into two types:"

For example, If we want to\ncalculate a single-bit error, the error correction code will determine which one of seven bits is in error. To\nachieve this, we have to add some additional redundant bits.\nSuppose r is the number of redundant bits and d is the total number of the data bits.

It controls the data packets between the two devices where\nreliable and gradual delivery of data frames is needed. It is also used in TCP (Transmission Control\nProtocol).\nIn this technique, each frame has sent from the sequence number. The sequence numbers are used to find the\nmissing data in the receiver end. The purpose of the sliding window technique is to avoid duplicate data, so\nit uses the sequence number.\nThree Features used for retransmission:\no In this case, the sender keeps the copies of all the transmitted frames until they have been\nacknowledged. Suppose the frames from 0 through 4 have been transmitted, and the last\nacknowledgement was for frame 2, the sender has to keep the copies of frames 3 and 4 until they\nreceive correctly.\no The receiver can send either NAK or ACK depending on the conditions. The NAK frame tells the\nsender that the data have been received damaged. Since the sliding window is a continuous\ntransmission mechanism, both ACK and NAK must be numbered for the identification of a frame.\nThe ACK frame consists of a number that represents the next frame which the receiver expects to\nreceive. The NAK frame consists of a number that represents the damaged frame.\no The sliding window ARQ is equipped with the timer to handle the lost acknowledgements. Suppose\nthen n-1 frames have been sent before receiving any acknowledgement. The sender waits for the\nacknowledgement, so it starts the timer and waits before sending any more. If the allotted time runs\nout, the sender retransmits one or all the frames depending upon the protocol used.\nTwo protocols used in sliding window ARQ:\no Go-Back-n ARQ: In Go-Back-N ARQ protocol, if one frame is lost or damaged, then it retransmits\nall the frames after which it does not receive the positive ACK.\no Go-Back-N ARQ protocol is also known as Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request. It is a data link\nlayer protocol that uses a sliding window method. In this, if any frame is corrupted or lost, all\nsubsequent frames have to be sent again.\no 61.4M\no 1.3K\no OOPs Concepts in Java\no The size of the sender window is N in this protocol. For example, Go-Back-8, the size of the sender\nwindow, will be 8. The receiver window size is always 1.\no If the receiver receives a corrupted frame, it cancels it. The receiver does not accept a corrupted\nframe. When the timer expires, the sender sends the correct frame again. The design of the\nGo-Back-N ARQ protocol is shown below."

The frame 3 is also\ndiscarded as it is transmitted after the damaged frame. Therefore, the sender retransmits the frames 2,3.\no Lost Data Frame: In Sliding window protocols, data frames are sent sequentially. If any of the\nframes is lost, then the next frame arrive at the receiver is out of sequence. The receiver checks the\nsequence number of each of the frame, discovers the frame that has been skipped, and returns the\nNAK for the missing frame. The sending device retransmits the frame indicated by NAK as well as\nthe frames transmitted after the lost frame.\no Lost Acknowledgement: The sender can send as many frames as the windows allow before waiting\nfor any acknowledgement. Once the limit of the window is reached, the sender has no more frames\nto send; it must wait for the acknowledgement. If the acknowledgement is lost, then the sender could\nwait forever. To avoid such situation, the sender is equipped with the timer that starts counting\nwhenever the window capacity is reached.

Let’s discuss it one by one.\nNetworking Communication:\nSliding window algorithms are methods of flow control for network data transfer. The data link layer uses a\nsender to have more than one acknowledgement packet at a time, which improves network throughput. Both\nthe sender and receiver maintain a finite-size buffer to hold outgoing and incoming packets from the other\nside. Every packet sends by the sender must be acknowledged by the receiver. The sender maintains a timer"

The sender may send a\nwhole window of packets before receiving an acknowledgement for the first packet in the window. This\nresults in higher transfer rates, as the sender may send multiple packets without waiting for each packet’s\nacknowledgement. The receiver advertises a window size that tells the sender not to fill up the receiver\nbuffers.\nEfficiency can also be improved by making use of full-duplex transmission. Full Duplex transmission is a\ntwo-way directional communication simultaneously. It provides better performance than simple and\nhalf-duplex transmission modes.\nFull-duplex transmission\nSolution 1 –\nOne way to achieve full-duplex transmission is to have two separate channels with one for forwarding data\ntransmission and the other for reverse data transfer (to accept). But this will almost completely waste the\nbandwidth of the reverse channel.\nSolution 2(Piggybacking) –\nA preferable solution would be to use each channel to transmit the frame (front and back) both ways, with\nboth channels having the same capacity. Assume that A and B are users. Then the data frames from A to B\nare interconnected with the acknowledgement from A to B. and can be identified as a data frame or\nacknowledgement by checking the sort field in the header of the received frame.\nOne more improvement can be made. When a data frame arrives, the receiver waits does not send the\ncontrol frame (acknowledgement) back immediately. The receiver waits until its network layer moves to the\nnext data packet.\nAcknowledgement is associated with this outgoing data frame. Thus the acknowledgement travels along\nwith the next data frame.\nDefinition of Piggybacking :\nThis technique in which the outgoing acknowledgement is delayed temporarily is called piggybacking."

When a teacher asks a question, all the\nstudents (small channels) in the class start answering the question at the same time (transferring the data\nsimultaneously). All the students respond at the same time due to which data is overlap or data lost.\nTherefore it is the responsibility of a teacher (multiple access protocol) to manage the students and make\nthem one answer.\nFollowing are the types of multiple access protocol that is subdivided into the different process as:\nA. Random Access Protocol\nIn this protocol, all the station has the equal priority to send the data over a channel. In random access\nprotocol, one or more stations cannot depend on another station nor any station control another station.\nDepending on the channel's state (idle or busy), each station transmits the data frame.

Instead of this, it waits for some time, and this time period is\ncalled the Interframe space or IFS.

It has three\ntypes of controlled access: Reservation, Polling, and Token Passing.\nIn controlled access, the stations seek information from one another to find which station has the right to\nsend. It allows only one node to send at a time, to avoid collision of messages on shared medium. The three\ncontrolled-access methods are:\n1. Reservation\n2. Polling\n3. Token Passing\nReservation\n● In the reservation method, a station needs to make a reservation before sending data.\n● The timeline has two kinds of periods:\n1. Reservation interval of fixed time length\n2. Data transmission period of variable frames.\n● If there are M stations, the reservation interval is divided into M slots, and each station has one\nslot.\n● Suppose if station 1 has a frame to send, it transmits 1 bit during the slot 1. No other station is\nallowed to transmit during this slot.\n● In general, i th station may announce that it has a frame to send by inserting a 1 bit into i th slot.\nAfter all N slots have been checked, each station knows which stations wish to transmit.\n● The stations which have reserved their slots transfer their frames in that order.\n● After data transmission period, next reservation interval begins.\n● Since everyone agrees on who goes next, there will never be any collisions.\nThe following figure shows a situation with five stations and a five-slot reservation frame.

In CDMA, all stations can\nsimultaneously send the data over the same channel. It means that it allows each station to transmit the data\nframes with full frequency on the shared channel at all times. It does not require the division of bandwidth\non a shared channel based on time slots. If multiple stations send data to a channel simultaneously, their data\nframes are separated by a unique code sequence. Each station has a different unique code for transmitting\nthe data over a shared channel. For example, there are multiple users in a room that are continuously\nspeaking. Data is received by the users if only two-person interact with each other using the same language.\nSimilarly, in the network, if different stations communicate with each other simultaneously with different\ncode language."

This tutorial will help you in\nunderstanding IPv6 and its associated terminologies along with appropriate references and examples.\nInternet Protocol version 6 is a new addressing protocol designed to incorporate all the possible\nrequirements of future Internet known to us as Internet version 2. This protocol as its predecessor IPv4,\nworks on the Network Layer (Layer-3). Along with its offering of an enormous amount of logical address\nspace, this protocol has ample features to which address the shortcoming of IPv4.\nWhy New IP Version?\nSo far, IPv4 has proven itself as a robust routable addressing protocol and has served us for decades on its\nbest-effort-delivery mechanism. It was designed in the early 80’s and did not get any major change\nafterward. At the time of its birth, Internet was limited only to a few universities for their research and to the\nDepartment of Defense. IPv4 is 32 bits long and offers around 4,294,967,296 (232) addresses. This address\nspace was considered more than enough that time. Given below are the major points that played a key role in\nthe birth of IPv6:\n● Internet has grown exponentially and the address space allowed by IPv4 is saturating. There is\na requirement to have a protocol that can satisfy the needs of future Internet addresses that is\nexpected to grow in an unexpected manner.\n● IPv4 on its own does not provide any security feature. Data has to be encrypted with some\nother security application before being sent on the Internet."

Though IPv4 has a few bits reserved for Type of\nService or Quality of Service, but they do not provide much functionality.\n● IPv4 enabled clients can be configured manually or they need some address configuration\nmechanism. It does not have a mechanism to configure a device to have globally unique IP\naddress.\nWhy Not IPv5?\nTill date, Internet Protocol has been recognized has IPv4 only. Version 0 to 3 were used while the protocol\nwas itself under development and experimental process. So, we can assume lots of background activities\nremain active before putting a protocol into production. Similarly, protocol version 5 was used while\nexperimenting with the stream protocol for Internet. It is known to us as Internet Stream Protocol which\nused Internet Protocol number 5 to encapsulate its datagram. It was never brought into public use, but it was\nalready used.\nHere is a table of IP versions and how they are used:\nBrief History\nAfter IPv4’s development in the early 80s, the available IPv4 address pool begun to shrink rapidly as the\ndemand of addresses exponentially increased with Internet. Taking pre-cognizance of the situation that\nmight arise, IETF, in 1994, initiated the development of an addressing protocol to replace IPv4. The progress\nof IPv6 can be tracked by means of the RFC published:\n● 1998 – RFC 2460 – Basic Protocol\n● 2003 – RFC 2553 – Basic Socket API\n● 2003 – RFC 3315 – DHCPv6\n● 2004 – RFC 3775 – Mobile IPv6\n● 2004 – RFC 3697 – Flow Label Specification\n● 2006 – RFC 4291 – Address architecture (revision)\n● 2006 – RFC 4294 – Node requirement\nOn June 06, 2012, some of the Internet giants chose to put their Servers on IPv6. Presently they are using\nDual Stack mechanism to implement IPv6 parallel in with IPv4.\nIPv6 - Features\nThe successor of IPv4 is not designed to be backward compatible. Trying to keep the basic functionalities of\nIP addressing, IPv6 is redesigned entirely. It offers the following features:"

            "text": "● Larger Address Space\nIn contrast to IPv4, IPv6 uses 4 times more bits to address a device on the Internet. This much\nof extra bits can provide approximately 3.4×1038 different combinations of addresses. This\naddress can accumulate the aggressive requirement of address allotment for almost everything\nin this world. According to an estimate, 1564 addresses can be allocated to every square meter\nof this earth.\n● Simplified Header\nIPv6’s header has been simplified by moving all unnecessary information and options (which\nare present in IPv4 header) to the end of the IPv6 header. IPv6 header is only twice as bigger\nthan IPv4 provided the fact that IPv6 address is four times longer.\n● End-to-end Connectivity\nEvery system now has unique IP address and can traverse through the Internet without using\nNAT or other translating components. After IPv6 is fully implemented, every host can directly\nreach other hosts on the Internet, with some limitations involved like Firewall, organization\npolicies, etc.\n● Auto-configuration\nIPv6 supports both stateful and stateless auto configuration mode of its host devices. This\nway, absence of a DHCP server does not put a halt on inter segment communication.\n● Faster Forwarding/Routing\nSimplified header puts all unnecessary information at the end of the header. The information\ncontained in the first part of the header is adequate for a Router to take routing decisions, thus\nmaking routing decision as quickly as looking at the mandatory header.\n● IPSec\nInitially it was decided that IPv6 must have IPSec security, making it more secure than IPv4.\nThis feature has now been made optional.\n● No Broadcast\nThough Ethernet/Token Ring are considered as broadcast network because they support\nBroadcasting, IPv6 does not have any broadcast support any more. It uses multicast to\ncommunicate with multiple hosts.\n● Anycast Support\nThis is another characteristic of IPv6. IPv6 has introduced Anycast mode of packet routing. In\nthis mode, multiple interfaces over the Internet are assigned same Anycast IP address.\nRouters, while routing, send the packet to the nearest destination.\n● Mobility\nIPv6 was designed keeping mobility in mind. This feature enables hosts (such as mobile\nphone) to roam around in different geographical area and remain connected with the same IP\naddress. The mobility feature of IPv6 takes advantage of auto IP configuration and Extension\nheaders.\n● Enhanced Priority Support\nIPv4 used 6 bits DSCP (Differential Service Code Point) and 2 bits ECN (Explicit Congestion\nNotification) to provide Quality of Service but it could only be used if the end-to-end devices\nsupport it, that is, the source and destination device and underlying network must support it.\nIn IPv6, Traffic class and Flow label are used to tell the underlying routers how to efficiently\nprocess the packet and route it.\n● Smooth Transition\nLarge IP address scheme in IPv6 enables to allocate devices with globally unique IP\naddresses. This mechanism saves IP addresses and NAT is not required. So devices can\nsend/receive data among each other, for example, VoIP and/or any streaming media can be\nused much efficiently.\nOther fact is, the header is less loaded, so routers can take forwarding decisions and forward\nthem as quickly as they arrive.\n● Extensibility\nOne of the major advantages of IPv6 header is that it is extensible to add more information in\nthe option part. IPv4 provides only 40-bytes for options, whereas options in IPv6 can be as\nmuch as the size of IPv6 packet itself."

More than one host can be\naddressed at once or the host at the closest distance can be addressed.\nUnicast\nIn unicast mode of addressing, an IPv6 interface (host) is uniquely identified in a network segment. The\nIPv6 packet contains both source and destination IP addresses. A host interface is equipped with an IP\naddress which is unique in that network segment.When a network switch or a router receives a unicast IP\npacket, destined to a single host, it sends out one of its outgoing interface which connects to that particular\nhost.\nMulticast\nThe IPv6 multicast mode is same as that of IPv4. The packet destined to multiple hosts is sent on a special\nmulticast address. All the hosts interested in that multicast information, need to join that multicast group\nfirst. All the interfaces that joined the group receive the multicast packet and process it, while other hosts not\ninterested in multicast packets ignore the multicast information."

In this addressing mode,\nmultiple interfaces (hosts) are assigned same Anycast IP address. When a host wishes to communicate with\na host equipped with an Anycast IP address, it sends a Unicast message. With the help of complex routing\nmechanism, that Unicast message is delivered to the host closest to the Sender in terms of Routing cost.\nLet’s take an example of TutorialPoints.com Web Servers, located in all continents. Assume that all the Web\nServers are assigned a single IPv6 Anycast IP Address. Now when a user from Europe wants to reach\nTutorialsPoint.com the DNS points to the server that is physically located in Europe itself.

Every digit in Hexadecimal can represent values from 0 to 15.\n[Image: Conversion Table]\nAddress Structure\nAn IPv6 address is made of 128 bits divided into eight 16-bits blocks.

IPv6 provides some rules to\nshorten the address. The rules are as follows:\nRule.1: Discard leading Zero(es):\nIn Block 5, 0063, the leading two 0s can be omitted, such as (5th block):\n2001:0000:3238:DFE1:63:0000:0000:FEFB\nRule.2: If two of more blocks contain consecutive zeroes, omit them all and replace with double colon sign\n::, such as (6th and 7th block):\n2001:0000:3238:DFE1:63::FEFB\nConsecutive blocks of zeroes can be replaced only once by :: so if there are still blocks of zeroes in the\naddress, they can be shrunk down to a single zero, such as (2nd block):\n2001:0:3238:DFE1:63::FEFB\nInterface ID"

In other words, routers make routing decisions based on subnets.\nIn this article, we will learn these concepts more briefly.\nScope\n● This article discusses what subnetting is along with its importance.\n● This article briefly describes step by step working of subnetting.\n● This article describes the various uses of subnetting.\n● This article also covers the advantages and disadvantages of subnetting.\nWhat is Subnetting?\nSubnetting is a method of dividing a single physical network into logical sub-networks (subnets). Subnetting\nallows a business to expand its network without requiring a new network number from its Internet service\nprovider. Subnetting helps to reduce the network traffic and also conceals network complexity. Subnetting is\nnecessary when a single network number must be assigned to several portions of a local area\nnetwork (LAN).\nWe know subnetting splits networks into small subnets, and do you think what these subnets are. A subnet,\nsometimes known as a subnetwork, is a part of a larger network. Subnets are the logical division of\nan IP network into many smaller network parts. To reduce traffic, a subnet's purpose is to divide a huge\nnetwork into a collection of smaller, interconnected networks. Subnets eliminate the need for traffic to pass\nthrough extraneous routs, resulting in faster network speeds. Subnets were created to alleviate the shortage\nof IP addresses on the internet.\nThe purpose of subnetting is to establish a computer network that is quick, efficient, and robust. As networks\ngrow in size and complexity, traffic must find more efficient pathways. Bottlenecks and congestion would\narise if all network traffic travelled across the system at the same time, utilizing the same path, resulting in\nslow and wasteful backlogs. By creating a subnet, you can limit the number of routers that network traffic\nmust pass through. An engineer will effectively establish smaller mini-routes within a larger network to\nallow traffic to go the shortest distance possible.\nWhat is the use of Subnetting?\nLarge enterprises looking to expand technologically need to know how to organize a network\nefficiently. IP addresses can be kept geographically confined, allowing a subnet to be used to preserve\nefficiency and order. Let’s look at some of the major motivations to use subnetting.\n1. Reallocating IP Addresses:- A limited number of host allocations are available for each class; for\nexample, networks with more than 254 devices require a Class B allocation. Suppose a network\nadministrator works with a Class B or C network and needs to allocate 150 hosts across three\nphysical networks in three different cities. In that case, they must either request more address blocks\nfor each network or divide the network into subnets that allow administrators to use one block of\naddresses across multiple physical networks.\n2. Improves Network Speed:- Subnetting divides the large network into small subnets, and the\npurpose of these subnets is to divide a huge network into a collection of smaller, interconnected\nnetworks to reduce traffic. Subnets eliminate the need for traffic to pass through extraneous routs,\nresulting in faster network speeds.\n3. Improving Network Security:- Subnetting helps network administrators to reduce\nnetwork-wide threats by quarantining compromised areas of the network and making it more\ncomplex for trespassers to travel throughout an organization's network.\n4. Reliving Network Congestion:- If a large portion of an organization's traffic is intended to be shared\nregularly across a group of computers, putting them all on the same subnet can help reduce network"

            "text": "traffic. Without a subnet, data packets from every other computer on the network would be visible to\nall computers and servers.\n5. Efficiency:- Subnetting is used to simplify network traffic by eliminating the need for additional\nrouters. This ensures that the data being sent can move as quickly as possible to its destination,\navoiding any potential detours that can slow it down.\nWhen a bigger network is divided into smaller networks, to maintain security, then that is known as\nSubnetting. So, maintenance is easier for smaller networks. For example, if we consider a class A address,\nthe possible number of hosts is 224 for each network, it is obvious that it is difficult to maintain such a huge\nnumber of hosts, but it would be quite easier to maintain if we divide the network into small parts. Now,\nlet’s talk about dividing a network into two parts: To divide a network into two parts, you need to choose\none bit for each Subnet from the host ID part.\nIn the above diagram, there are two Subnets. Note: It is a class C IP so, there are 24 bits in the network id\npart and 8 bits in the host id part.\nSubnetting for a network should be done in such a way that it does not affect the network bits. In class\nC the first 3 octets are network bits so it remains as it is.\n● For Subnet-1: The first bit which is chosen from the host id part is zero and the range will be\nfrom (193.1.2.00000000 till you get all 1’s in the host ID part i.e, 193.1.2.01111111) except for\nthe first bit which is chosen zero for subnet id part. Thus, the range of subnet-1:\n193.1.2.0 to 193.1.2.127\nSubnet id of Subnet-1 is : 193.1.2.0\nDirect Broadcast id of Subnet-1 is : 193.1.2.127\nTotal number of host possible is : 126 (Out of 128, 2 id’s are used for Subnet id & Direct Broadcast\nid)\nSubnet mask of Subnet- 1 is : 255.255.255.128\n● For Subnet-2: The first bit chosen from the host id part is one and the range will be from\n(193.1.2.100000000 till you get all 1’s in the host ID part i.e, 193.1.2.11111111). Thus, the range\nof subnet-2:\n193.1.2.128 to 193.1.2.255\nSubnet id of Subnet-2 is : 193.1.2.128\nDirect Broadcast id of Subnet-2 is : 193.1.2.255\nTotal number of host possible is : 126 (Out of 128, 2 id’s are used for Subnet id & Direct Broadcast\nid)\nSubnet mask of Subnet- 2 is : 255.255.255.192\nFinally, after using the subnetting the total number of usable hosts are reduced from 254 to 252."

The Proxy ARP configured router responds to the ARP\nand map the MAC address of the router with the target IP address and fool the sender that it is reached at its\ndestination.\nAt the backend, the proxy router sends its packets to the appropriate destination because the packets contain\nthe necessary information.\nExample - If Host A wants to transmit data to Host B, which is on the different network, then Host A sends\nan ARP request message to receive a MAC address for Host B. The router responds to Host A with its own\nMAC address pretend itself as a destination. When the data is transmitted to the destination by Host A, it\nwill send to the gateway so that it sends to Host B. This is known as proxy ARP.\nGratuitous ARP - Gratuitous ARP is an ARP request of the host that helps to identify the duplicate IP\naddress. It is a broadcast request for the IP address of the router. If an ARP request is sent by a switch or\nrouter to get its IP address and no ARP responses are received, so all other nodes cannot use the IP address\nallocated to that switch or router. Yet if a router or switch sends an ARP request for its IP address and\nreceives an ARP response, another node uses the IP address allocated to the switch or router.\nThere are some primary use cases of gratuitous ARP that are given below:\no The gratuitous ARP is used to update the ARP table of other devices.\no It also checks whether the host is using the original IP address or a duplicate one.\nReverse ARP (RARP) - It is a networking protocol used by the client system in a local area network (LAN)\nto request its IPv4 address from the ARP gateway router table. A table is created by the network\nadministrator in the gateway-router that is used to find out the MAC address to the corresponding IP\naddress.\nWhen a new system is set up or any machine that has no memory to store the IP address, then the user has to\nfind the IP address of the device. The device sends a RARP broadcast packet, including its own MAC\naddress in the address field of both the sender and the receiver hardware. A host installed inside of the local\nnetwork called the RARP-server is prepared to respond to such type of broadcast packet. The RARP server\nis then trying to locate a mapping table entry in the IP to MAC address. If any entry matches the item in the\ntable, then the RARP server sends the response packet along with the IP address to the requesting computer."

            "text": "In this article, we will discuss the bootstrapping protocol and how it plays its important role in maintaining\nthe protocol between connected devices on a network. Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a networking\nprotocol which is used by networking administration to give IP addresses to each member of that network\nfor participating with other networking devices by the main server.\nImportant Features of Bootstrap Protocol :\nHere, we will discuss the features of Bootstrap Protocol as follows.\n● Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a basic protocol that automatically provides each participant in a\nnetwork connection with a unique IP address for identification and authentication as soon as it\nconnects to the network. This helps the server to speed up data transfers and connection requests.\n● BOOTP uses a unique IP address algorithm to provide each system on the network with a\ncompletely different IP address in a fraction of a second.\n● This shortens the connection time between the server and the client. It starts the process of\ndownloading and updating the source code even with very little information.\n● BOOTP uses a combination of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and UDP (User\nDatagram Protocol) to request and receive requests from various network-connected participants\nand to handle their responses.\n● In a BOOTP connection, the server and client just need an IP address and a gateway address to\nestablish a successful connection. Typically, in a BOOTP network, the server and client share the\nsame LAN, and the routers used in the network must support BOOTP bridging.\n● A great example of a network with a TCP / IP configuration is the Bootstrap Protocol network.\nWhenever a computer on the network asks for a specific request to the server, BOOTP uses its\nunique IP address to quickly resolve them.\nHow Bootstrap Protocol differs from DHCP :\nDHCP network servers have much broader use than a BOOTP network server. It may be used for the\npurpose when a user gives request to the server for a particular IP address and it gives the response of that\nparticular IP address only, hence, time is not wasted for monitoring other addresses. BOOTP\nuses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) through an IPv4 address connection to identify and authenticate each\nnetwork user. Also, a BOOTP connection has a stable static database of IP addresses which serves the client\nimmediately with the required IP address.\nWorking of Bootstrap Protocol :\nHere, we will discuss the Working steps of Bootstrap Protocol as follows.\n● At the very beginning, each network participant does not have an IP address. The network\nadministrator then provides each host on the network with a unique IP address using the IPv4\nprotocol.\n● The client installs the BOOTP network protocol using TCP / IP Intervention on its computer\nsystem to ensure compatibility with all network protocols when connected to this network.\n● The BOOTP network administrator then sends a message that contains a valid unicast address.\nThis unicast address is then forwarded to the BOOTP client by the master server.\nUses of Bootstrap Protocol :\nHere, we will discuss the uses of Bootstrap Protocol as follows.\n1. Bootstrap (BOOTP) is primarily required to check the system on a network the first time you\nstart your computer. Records the BIOS cycle of each computer on the network to allow the\ncomputer’s motherboard and network manager to efficiently organize the data transfer on the\ncomputer as soon as it boots up.\n2. BOOTP is mainly used in a diskless environment and requires no media as all data is stored in\nthe network cloud for efficient use.\n3. BOOTP is the transfer of a data between a client and a server to send and receive requests and\ncorresponding responses by the networking server."

Therefore, there is no requirement for any user configuration to connect to a\nDHCP based network.\nDHCP can be implemented on local networks as well as large enterprise networks. DHCP is the default\nprotocol used by the most routers and networking equipment. DHCP is also called RFC (Request for\ncomments) 2131.\nDHCP does the following:\no DHCP manages the provision of all the nodes or devices added or dropped from the network.\no DHCP maintains the unique IP address of the host using a DHCP server.\no It sends a request to the DHCP server whenever a client/node/device, which is configured to work\nwith DHCP, connects to a network. The server acknowledges by providing an IP address to the\nclient/node/device.\nDHCP is also used to configure the proper subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server information on the\nnode or device.\nThere are many versions of DCHP are available for use in IPV4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) and IPV6\n(Internet Protocol Version 6).\nHow DHCP works\nDHCP runs at the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack to dynamically assign IP addresses to\nDHCP clients/nodes and to allocate TCP/IP configuration information to the DHCP clients. Information\nincludes subnet mask information, default gateway, IP addresses and domain name system addresses.\nDHCP is based on client-server protocol in which servers manage a pool of unique IP addresses, as well as\ninformation about client configuration parameters, and assign addresses out of those address pools.\nThe DHCP lease process works as follows:\no First of all, a client (network device) must be connected to the internet.\no DHCP clients request an IP address. Typically, client broadcasts a query for this information.\no DHCP server responds to the client request by providing IP server address and other configuration\ninformation. This configuration information also includes time period, called a lease, for which the\nallocation is valid.\no When refreshing an assignment, a DHCP clients request the same parameters, but the DHCP server\nmay assign a new IP address. This is based on the policies set by the administrator.\nComponents of DHCP\nWhen working with DHCP, it is important to understand all of the components. Following are the list of\ncomponents:\no DHCP Server: DHCP server is a networked device running the DCHP service that holds IP\naddresses and related configuration information. This is typically a server or a router but could be\nanything that acts as a host, such as an SD-WAN appliance.\no DHCP client: DHCP client is the endpoint that receives configuration information from a DHCP\nserver. This can be any device like computer, laptop, IoT endpoint or anything else that requires\nconnectivity to the network. Most of the devices are configured to receive DHCP information by\ndefault."

We will also see the services provided by transport layer and transport layer\nprotocols.\nWhat is transport Layer?\n● Transport Layer is the fourth layer from the top in OSI Model which provide\ncommunication services to the application processes that was running on different\nhosts.\n● Transport Layer provides the services to the session layer and it receives the services\nfrom network layer.\n● The services provided by transport layer includes error correction as well as\nsegmenting and desegmenting data before and after it's sent on the network.\n● Transport layer also provides the flow control functionality and ensures that\nsegmented data is delivered across the network in the right sequence.\nNote: Main duty of transport layer is to provide process to process communication.\nServices provided by Transport Layer\n1. Process to Process Communication\nTransport Layer is responsible for delivery of message to appropriate process.\nTransport Layer uses a port number to deliver the segmented data to the correct process\namongst the multiple processes that are running on a particular host. A port number is\na 16-bit address used by transport layer to identify any client-server program.\n2. Muliplexing and Demultiplexing\nThe transport layer provides the multiplexing service to improve transmission efficiency in\ndata communication. At the receiver side, demultiplexing is required to collect the data\ncoming from different processes. Transport Layer provides Upward and Downward\nMultiplexing:"

            "text": "Upward multiplexing means multiple transport layer connections utilizes the connection of\nsame network. Transport layer transmits several transmissions bound for the same destination\nalong the same path in network.\nDownward multiplexing means a transport layer connection utilizes the multiple\nconnections. This multiplexing allows the transport layer to split a network connection\namong several paths to improve the throughput in network.\n3. Flow Control\n● Flow control makes sure that the data is transmitted at a rate that is accept table for\nboth sender and receiver by managing data flow.\n● The transport layer provides a flow control service between the adjacent layers of the\nTCP/IP model. Transport Layer uses the concept of sliding window protocol to\nprovide flow control.\n4. Data integrity\nTransport Layer provides data integrity by:\n● Detecting and discarding corrupted packets.\n● Tracking of lost and discarded packets and re-transmit them.\n● Recognizing duplicate packets and discarding them.\n● Buffering out of order packets until the missing the packets arrive.\n5. Congestion avoidance\n● In network, if the load on network is greater than the network load capacity, then the\ncongestion may occur.\n● Congestion Control refers to the mechanisms and techniques to control the congestion\nand keep the load below the capacity.\n● The transport layer recognizes overloaded nodes and reduced flow rates and take\nproper steps to overcome this.\nExample of Transport Layer\nLet us understand transport layer with the help of example. Let us take an example of sending\nemail.\n● When we send an email then the email then in OSI model each layer communicates to\nthe corresponding layer of the receiver.\n● So when the mail will come at transport layer on sender side then the email is broken\ndown in to small segments. Then that broken segments are sent to network layer and\ntransport layer also specifies the source and destination port.\n● At the receiver side, transport layer reassembles all the segment to get the data and\nuse port number to identify the application to deliver data.\nWorking of Transport Layer"

Before getting into\nthe details, let us look at some basics. TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol which\nindicates that it does something to control the transmission of the data in a reliable way.\nThe process of communication between devices over the internet happens according to the\ncurrent TCP/IP suite model(stripped out version of OSI reference model). The Application\nlayer is a top pile of a stack of TCP/IP models from where network referenced applications\nlike web browsers on the client-side establish a connection with the server. From the\napplication layer, the information is transferred to the transport layer where our topic comes\ninto the picture. The two important protocols of this layer are – TCP, UDP(User Datagram\nProtocol) out of which TCP is prevalent(since it provides reliability for the connection\nestablished). However, you can find an application of UDP in querying the DNS server to get\nthe binary equivalent of the Domain Name used for the website.\nTCP provides reliable communication with something called Positive Acknowledgement\nwith Re-transmission(PAR). The Protocol Data Unit(PDU) of the transport layer is called a\nsegment. Now a device using PAR resend the data unit until it receives an acknowledgement.\nIf the data unit received at the receiver’s end is damaged(It checks the data with checksum\nfunctionality of the transport layer that is used for Error Detection), the receiver discards the\nsegment. So the sender has to resend the data unit for which positive acknowledgement is not\nreceived. You can realize from the above mechanism that three segments are exchanged\nbetween sender(client) and receiver(server) for a reliable TCP connection to get established.\nLet us delve into how this mechanism works :"

Traffic\nShaping is a mechanism to control the amount and the rate of traffic sent to the network.\nApproach of congestion management is called Traffic shaping. Traffic shaping helps to\nregulate the rate of data transmission and reduces congestion.\nThere are 2 types of traffic shaping algorithms:\n1. Leaky Bucket\n2. Token Bucket\nSuppose we have a bucket in which we are pouring water, at random points in time, but we\nhave to get water at a fixed rate, to achieve this we will make a hole at the bottom of the\nbucket. This will ensure that the water coming out is at some fixed rate, and also if the bucket\ngets full, then we will stop pouring water into it.\nThe input rate can vary, but the output rate remains constant.

The outside world\nwill be able to access the domain name at all times without having to worry\nabout IP changes.\nApplications of DDNS\nSince domain controllers register their network service types in DNS so that other computers\nin the domain (or forest) can access them, dynamic DNS is an essential aspect of Active\nDirectory in Microsoft Windows networks.\nDDNS for Internet Access Devices\n● Dynamic DNS providers provide a software client programme that automates\ndiscovering and registering public IP addresses for the client system. On a\ncomputer or device in the private network, the client programme is run. It uses\na unique login name to connect to the DDNS provider's systems.\n● The provider uses the name to associate the found public IP address of the\nhome network with a domain name system hostname.\nFor Security\n● For IP-based security products like DVRs and IP cameras, dynamic DNS is an\nexpected feature, if not a requirement. The usage of current DDNS services or\nnew services hosted by the manufacturer are only two of the alternatives\navailable to manufacturers these days.\n● A simple HTTP-based update API is nearly always utilised because it enables\nstraightforward integration of a DDNS client into a device's firmware.\n● MintDNS, cURL, and Inadyn are just a few examples of pre-made tools to\nhelp with server and client development.\n● Most web-based DDNS providers use a common username and password\nsecurity scheme. A user must first create an account on the DDNS server\nwebsite, after which they must set up their device to submit updates to the\nDDNS server anytime an IP address change is detected.\nBenefits of Using a DDNS:\nFollowing are some of the benefits of using a dynamic DNS\n● You can visit your website or server from any location on the planet without\nworrying about your IP address changing. A device on your network sends\nyour IP address to the DDNS service regularly.\n● Your network administrators will save time by not having to update settings\nwith each IP address change, allowing them to focus on the health of your\nnetwork.\n● You won't have to manually update all of your records whenever your IP\naddress changes.

For example, two systems may have different file\nconventions. Two systems may have different ways to represent text and data. Two systems\nmay have different directory structures. FTP protocol overcomes these problems by\nestablishing two connections between hosts. One connection is used for data transfer, and\nanother connection is used for the control connection.\nMechanism of FTP\nThe above figure shows the basic model of the FTP. The FTP client has three components:\nthe user interface, control process, and data transfer process. The server has two components:\nthe server control process and the server data transfer process.\nThere are two types of connections in FTP:"

Through control connection, we can transfer a line of command or\nline of response at a time. The control connection is made between the control\nprocesses. The control connection remains connected during the entire interactive\nFTP session.\no Data Connection: The Data Connection uses very complex rules as data types may\nvary. The data connection is made between data transfer processes. The data\nconnection opens when a command comes for transferring the files and closes when\nthe file is transferred.\nFTP Clients\no FTP client is a program that implements a file transfer protocol which allows you to\ntransfer files between two hosts on the internet.\no It allows a user to connect to a remote host and upload or download the files.\no It has a set of commands that we can use to connect to a host, transfer the files\nbetween you and your host and close the connection.\no The FTP program is also available as a built-in component in a Web browser. This\nGUI based FTP client makes the file transfer very easy and also does not require to\nremember the FTP commands.\nAdvantages of FTP:\no Speed: One of the biggest advantages of FTP is speed. The FTP is one of the fastest\nway to transfer the files from one computer to another computer.\no Efficient: It is more efficient as we do not need to complete all the operations to get\nthe entire file.\no Security: To access the FTP server, we need to login with the username and\npassword. Therefore, we can say that FTP is more secure.\no Back & forth movement: FTP allows us to transfer the files back and forth.

A\nparticular collection of web pages that belong to a specific URL is called a website,\ne.g., www.facebook.com, www.google.com, etc. So, the World Wide Web is like a huge\nelectronic book whose pages are stored on multiple servers across the world.\nSmall websites store all of their WebPages on a single server, but big websites or\norganizations place their WebPages on different servers in different countries so that when\nusers of a country search their site they could get the information quickly from the nearest\nserver.\nSo, the web provides a communication platform for users to retrieve and exchange\ninformation over the internet.

Your computer is\ncalled a client who runs a program (web browser), and asks the other computer (server) for\nthe information it needs.\nHistory of the World Wide Web:\nThe World Wide Web was invented by a British scientist, Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He was\nworking at CERN at that time. Originally, it was developed by him to fulfill the need of\nautomated information sharing between scientists across the world, so that they could easily\nshare the data and results of their experiments and studies with each other.\nCERN, where Tim Berners worked, is a community of more than 1700 scientists from more\nthan 100 countries. These scientists spend some time on CERN site, and rest of the time they\nwork at their universities and national laboratories in their home countries, so there was a\nneed for reliable communication tools so that they can exchange information.\nInternet and Hypertext were available at this time, but no one thought how to use the internet\nto link or share one document to another. Tim focused on three main technologies that could\nmake computers understand each other, HTML, URL, and HTTP. So, the objective behind\nthe invention of WWW was to combine recent computer technologies, data networks, and\nhypertext into a user-friendly and effective global information system.\nHow the Invention Started:\nIn March 1989, Tim Berners-Lee took the initiative towards the invention of WWW and\nwrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web. Later, he wrote another proposal in May\n1990. After a few months, in November 1990, along with Robert Cailliau, it was formalized\nas a management proposal. This proposal had outlined the key concepts and defined\nterminology related to the Web. In this document, there was a description of \"hypertext\nproject\" called World Wide Web in which a web of hypertext documents could be viewed by\nbrowsers. His proposal included the three main technologies (HTML, URL, and HTTP)."

He used a NeXT computer to develop the code for his Web server and\nput a note on the computer \"The machine is a server. Do Not Power It DOWN!!\" So that it\nwas not switched off accidentally by someone.\nIn 1991, Tim created the world's first website and Web Server. Its address was info.cern.ch,\nand it was running at CERN on the NeXT computer. Furthermore, the first web page address\nwas http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html. This page had links to the\ninformation related to the WWW project, and also about the Web servers, hypertext\ndescription, and information for creating a Web server.\nThe Web Grows:\nNeXT computer platform was accessible by a few users. Later, the development of\n'line-mode' browser, which could run on any system, started. In 1991, Berners-Lee introduced\nhis WWW software with 'line-mode' browser, Web server software and a library for\ndevelopers.\nIn March 1991, it was available to colleagues who were using CERN computers. After a few\nmonths, in August 1991, he introduced the WWW software on internet newsgroups, and it\ngenerated interest in the project across the world. Graphic interface for the internet, first\nintroduced to the public on 6 August 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee. On 23 August 1991, it was\navailable to everyone.\nBecoming Global:\nThe first Web server came online in December 1991 in the United States. At this time, there\nwere only two types of browsers; the original development version which was available only\non NeXT machines and the 'line-mode' browser which was easy to install and run on any\nplatform but was less user-friendly and had limited power.\nFor further improvement, Berners-Lee asked other developers via the internet to contribute to\nits development. Many developers wrote browsers for the X-Window System. The first web\nserver, outside Europe, was introduced at Standard University in the United States in 1991. In\nthe same year, there were only ten known web servers across the world.\nLater at the beginning of 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications\n(NCSA) introduced the first version of its Mosaic browser. It ran in the X Window System\nenvironment. Later, the NCSA released versions for the PC and Macintosh environments.\nWith the introduction of user-friendly browsers on these computers, the WWW started\nspreading tremendously across the world.\nEventually, the European Commission approved its first web project in the same year with\nCERN as one of its partners. In April 1993, CERN made the source code of WWW available\non a royalty-free basis and thus made it free software. Royalty-free means one has the right to\nuse copyright material or intellectual property without paying any royalty or license fee.\nThus, CERN allowed people to use the code and web protocol for free. The technologies that\nwere developed to make the WWW became an open source to allow people to use them for\nfree. Eventually, people started creating websites for online businesses, to provide\ninformation and other similar purposes.\nAt the end of 1993, there were more than 500 web servers, and the WWW has 1% of the total\ninternet traffic.

It was organized by the NCSA and the newly-formed International WWW\nConference Committee (IW3C2). At the end of this year (1994), the World Wide Web had\naround 10000 servers and 10 million users. The technology was continuously improved to\nfulfill growing needs and security, and e-commerce tools were decided to be added soon.\nOpen standards:\nThe main objective was to keep the Web an open standard for all rather than a proprietary\nsystem. Accordingly, CERN sent a proposal to the Commission of the European Union under\nthe ESPRIT program \"WebCore.\" This project's objective was to form an international\nconsortium in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the US. In\n1994, Berners-Lee left CERN and joined MIT and established the International World Wide\nWeb Consortium (W3C) and a new European partner was needed for W3C.\nThe European Commission approached the French National Institute for Research in\nComputer Science and Controls (INRIA), to substitute the CERN's role. Eventually, in April\n1995, INRIA became the first European W3C host and in 1996 Keio University of Japan\nbecame another host in Asia.\nIn 2003, ERCIM (European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics) replaced\nINRIA for the role of European W3C Host.

Thus, we can say that there is a\ntotal of 8 active nodes which are present at a distance of 10 meters. The communication\nbetween the primary and secondary nodes can be one-to-one or one-to-many. Possible\ncommunication is only between the master and slave; Slave-slave communication is not\npossible. It also has 255 parked nodes, these are secondary nodes and cannot take\nparticipation in communication unless it gets converted to the active state.\nScatternet:\nIt is formed by using various piconets. A slave that is present in one piconet can act as\nmaster or we can say primary in another piconet. This kind of node can receive a message\nfrom a master in one piconet and deliver the message to its slave in the other piconet where it\nis acting as a slave. This type of node is referred to as a bridge node. A station cannot be\nmastered in two piconets."

On the other hand, a software firewall is a\nsimple program installed on a computer that works through port numbers and other installed\nsoftware.\nApart from that, there are cloud-based firewalls. They are commonly referred to as FaaS\n(firewall as a service). A primary advantage of using cloud-based firewalls is that they can be\nmanaged centrally. Like hardware firewalls, cloud-based firewalls are best known for\nproviding perimeter security.\nWhy Firewall\nFirewalls are primarily used to prevent malware and network-based attacks. Additionally,\nthey can help in blocking application-layer attacks. These firewalls act as a gatekeeper or a\nbarrier. They monitor every attempt between our computer and another network. They do not\nallow data packets to be transferred through them unless the data is coming or going from a\nuser-specified trusted source.\nFirewalls are designed in such a way that they can react quickly to detect and counter-attacks\nthroughout the network. They can work with rules configured to protect the network and\nperform quick assessments to find any suspicious activity. In short, we can point to the\nfirewall as a traffic controller.\nSome of the important risks of not having a firewall are:\nOpen Access\nIf a computer is running without a firewall, it is giving open access to other networks. This\nmeans that it is accepting every kind of connection that comes through someone. In this case,\nit is not possible to detect threats or attacks coming through our network. Without a firewall,\nwe make our devices vulnerable to malicious users and other unwanted sources.\nLost or Comprised Data\nWithout a firewall, we are leaving our devices accessible to everyone. This means that\nanyone can access our device and have complete control over it, including the network. In\nthis case, cybercriminals can easily delete our data or use our personal information for their\nbenefit.\nNetwork Crashes\nIn the absence of a firewall, anyone could access our network and shut it down. It may lead\nus to invest our valuable time and money to get our network working again.\nTherefore, it is essential to use firewalls and keep our network, computer, and data safe and\nsecure from unwanted sources.\nBrief History of Firewall\nFirewalls have been the first and most reliable component of defense in network security for\nover 30 years. Firewalls first came into existence in the late 1980s. They were initially\ndesigned as packet filters. These packet filters were nothing but a setup of networks between\ncomputers. The primary function of these packet filtering firewalls was to check for packets\nor bytes transferred between different computers.\nFirewalls have become more advanced due to continuous development, although such packet\nfiltering firewalls are still in use in legacy systems."

Back in\n2000, Netscreen came up with its purpose-built firewall 'Appliance'. It gained popularity\nand fast adoption within enterprises because of increased internet speed, less latency, and\nhigh throughput at a lower cost.\nThe turn of the century saw a new approach to firewall implementation during the mid-2010.\nThe 'Next-Generation Firewalls' were introduced by the Palo Alto Networks. These\nfirewalls came up with a variety of built-in functions and capabilities, such as Hybrid Cloud\nSupport, Network Threat Prevention, Application and Identity-Based Control, and Scalable\nPerformance, etc. Firewalls are still getting new features as part of continuous development.\nThey are considered the first line of defense when it comes to network security.\nHow does a firewall work?\nA firewall system analyzes network traffic based on pre-defined rules. It then filters the\ntraffic and prevents any such traffic coming from unreliable or suspicious sources. It only\nallows incoming traffic that is configured to accept.\nTypically, firewalls intercept network traffic at a computer's entry point, known as a port.\nFirewalls perform this task by allowing or blocking specific data packets (units of\ncommunication transferred over a digital network) based on pre-defined security rules.\nIncoming traffic is allowed only through trusted IP addresses, or sources.\nFunctions of Firewall\nAs stated above, the firewall works as a gatekeeper. It analyzes every attempt coming to gain\naccess to our operating system and prevents traffic from unwanted or non-recognized\nsources.\nSince the firewall acts as a barrier or filter between the computer system and other networks\n(i.e., the public Internet), we can consider it as a traffic controller. Therefore, a firewall's\nprimary function is to secure our network and information by controlling network traffic,\npreventing unwanted incoming network traffic, and validating access by assessing network\ntraffic for malicious things such as hackers and malware."

The best practice is to use a firewall system when\nusing the Internet. However, it is important to use other defense systems to help protect the\nnetwork and data stored on the computer. Because cyber threats are continually evolving, a\nfirewall should not be the only consideration for protecting the home network.\nThe importance of using firewalls as a security system is obvious; however, firewalls have\nsome limitations:\no Firewalls cannot stop users from accessing malicious websites, making it vulnerable\nto internal threats or attacks.\no Firewalls cannot protect against the transfer of virus-infected files or software.\no Firewalls cannot prevent misuse of passwords.\no Firewalls cannot protect if security rules are misconfigured.\no Firewalls cannot protect against non-technical security risks, such as social\nengineering.\no Firewalls cannot stop or prevent attackers with modems from dialing in to or out of\nthe internal network.\no Firewalls cannot secure the system which is already infected.\nTherefore, it is recommended to keep all Internet-enabled devices updated.
